## Hardware Setup Notes

- **Handle with Care**: Always handle the OpenBCI Cyton Board and its components carefully to avoid damage.
- **Stands Usage**: While setting up the hardware, do not place the board inside the stands unless necessary. If you choose to use the stands, only insert them into the holes present on the Cyton board designed for this purpose.
- **Reset Button**: Avoid pressing the reset button on the Cyton board unless absolutely required, as it may interrupt the operation or reset unintended settings.

## Software Troubleshooting Tips

When using the OpenBCI GUI to stream data from the Cyton board, you may encounter issues with data streaming. Here are some steps to resolve common problems:

- **Channels Not Showing Data**: If the channels do not display a data stream:
  - Try switching the channels on and off from the GUI interface to reset the connection.
- **Data Streaming Stops**: If the data stream halts unexpectedly:
  - Restart the OpenBCI GUI application to re-establish the connection and resume streaming.

For additional troubleshooting and setup instructions, refer to the official OpenBCI documentation or the product page linked above.
